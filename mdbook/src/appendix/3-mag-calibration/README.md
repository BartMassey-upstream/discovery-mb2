# Calibration

One very important thing to do before using a sensor and trying to develop an application using it
is verifying that it's output is actually correct.  If this does not happen to be the case we need
to calibrate the sensor (alternatively it could also be broken but that's rather unlikely in this
case).

In my case, on two different micro:bit's the magnetometer without calibration was quite a bit off.
Hence for the purposes of this chapter we will just assume that the sensor has to be calibrated.

The calibration involves quite a bit of math (matrices) so we won't cover it here but this [Design
Note] describes the procedure if you are interested.

Luckily for us though the group that built the original software for the micro:bit already
implemented a calibration mechanism in C++ over [here].

You can find a translation of it to Rust in `src/bin/calibration/calibration.rs`. The usage is
demonstrated in the default `src/bin/calibration/main.rs` file.  Run this code with `cargo embed
--bin calibration`.

The way the calibration works is illustrated in this video from the C++ version. (Ignore the initial
printing â€” the calibration starts about halfway through.)

You have to tilt the micro:bit until all the LEDs on the LED matrix light up. The blinking cursor
shows the current target LED.

If you do not want to play the game every time you restart your application during development feel
free to modify `src/calibration.rs` to return a static calibration once you have it.

Now that we've got the sensor calibration out of the way let's look into actually building this
application!
